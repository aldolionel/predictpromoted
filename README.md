Here the instructions are.
1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis of that dataset (Including data cleansing, data visualization, and insight findings). 
2. Create classifiers with minimum of 5 algorithms (KNN, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Ensemble Learning: Averaging, Voting, Bagging, XGBoost, LGBM, and CatBoost) with model performance evaluation AUC of ROC. Choose one of the best model and elaborate why. 
3. What will be your suggestion to deploy and maintain this model lifecycle?
